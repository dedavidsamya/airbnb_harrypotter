This is an Airbnb clone, but Harry Potter themed. In this app, users can rent flats in several different locations of the wizarding world!
In addition to that, they can also offer their flats (and include pictures of it) to other users. 
The app displays the available flats for each location chosen, contains a booking system and allows users to upload pictures of their own flats.

It was built in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SASS, and uses Cloudinary for picture upload and the Devise Gem for authentication.



Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
